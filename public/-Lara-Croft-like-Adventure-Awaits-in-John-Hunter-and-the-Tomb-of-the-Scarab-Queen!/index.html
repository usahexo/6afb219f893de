<p>In John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen, players will take on the role of John Hunter, an archaeologist and adventurer who must travel deep into the jungles of Central America in search of a lost pyramid belonging to the long-lost Queen Nefertiti. Filled with traps, puzzles, and deadly creatures, the pyramid is said to contain a valuable artifact that could grant its owner immense power.</p>
<p>“John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen is our love letter to classic action adventure games like Tomb Raider and The Last Crusade,” said Puzzle Forge Creative Director Andres Martinez Moreno. “We wanted to create a game that would recapture that sense of excitement and exploration, while also providing a challenging experience that will test players’ wits and dexterity.”</p>
<p>The game promises to be packed with exciting set pieces and perilous platforming challenges, as players dodge traps, solve puzzles, and battle through hordes of deadly enemies in order to reach the pyramid’s inner chambers. In addition, John Hunter features a wide variety of weapons and gadgets to help him survive his quest, including a machete for close combat, a revolver for long range combat, binoculars for scouting out enemy positions, and more.</p>
<p>John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen is scheduled for release in Q1 2018 on PC, Mac, Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Nintendo Switch, iOS and Android devices.</p>
<h1 id="Can-You-Solve-the-Riddles-and-Claim-the-Treasure-of-John-Hunter-and-the-Tomb-of-the-Scarab-Queen"><a href="#Can-You-Solve-the-Riddles-and-Claim-the-Treasure-of-John-Hunter-and-the-Tomb-of-the-Scarab-Queen" class="headerlink" title="Can You Solve the Riddles and Claim the Treasure of John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen?"></a>Can You Solve the Riddles and Claim the Treasure of John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen?</h1><p>The Tomb of the Scarab Queen is a notorious archaeological site located in the Egyptian desert. The tomb has been sealed for thousands of years, and is rumored to contain vast amounts of treasure. In 2010, an international team of archaeologists led by John Hunter set out to solve the tomb’s mysteries and claim the treasure.</p>
<p>The expedition was met with disaster, however, as the team was quickly ambushed by bandits. Hunter was killed, and the rest of the team was captured. The bandits took the team to a remote location in the desert and threw them into a pit. The team managed to escape, but they were left stranded in the desert without food or water.</p>
<p>In desperation, the team turned to the Tomb of the Scarab Queen for help. They managed to find an entrance to the tomb, but they were quickly attacked by traps and deadly creatures infesting the place. Finally, after weeks of exploration and danger, they reached the treasure room.</p>
<p>But it was too late. The bandits had already arrived and seized all of the treasure. In anger, the team fought off the bandits and killed them all. But it was a pyrrhic victory - they had lost John Hunter, their leader and friend.</p>
<p>Now it’s your turn to try and solve the puzzles of the Tomb of the Scarab Queen. Can you claim its treasure before you meet a similar fate as John Hunter?</p>
<h1 id="Enter-at-Your-Own-Risk-A-Look-Inside-John-Hunter-and-the-Tomb-of-the-Scarab-Queen"><a href="#Enter-at-Your-Own-Risk-A-Look-Inside-John-Hunter-and-the-Tomb-of-the-Scarab-Queen" class="headerlink" title="Enter at Your Own Risk: A Look Inside John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen"></a>Enter at Your Own Risk: A Look Inside John Hunter and the Tomb of the Scarab Queen</h1><p>Hollywood movies have a way of romanticizing archeology. You know, the adventure, the danger, and of course, the glamorous treasure seekers. But in reality, the work is often slow, tedious, and filled with more colorless dirt than sparkling gold coins.</p>
<p>Still, every now and then an archeologist comes across something truly extraordinary – like John Hunter and his discovery of the Tomb of the Scarab Queen.</p>
<p>Hunter was a self-taught archeologist who had been exploring the deserts of Egypt for more than 30 years when he made his incredible find. In 1988, he stumbled upon a small opening in the side of a hill that led to a hidden tomb.</p>
<p>The tomb was filled with ancient Egyptian artifacts, including statues, jewelry, and even a mummy. But the most remarkable discovery was a sarcophagus containing the remains of a female Pharaoh named Ahmose-Nefertari.</p>
<p>Experts believe that Ahmose-Nefertari was one of the first female Pharaohs in ancient Egypt and that her tomb had been sealed for more than 3,000 years. Hunter’s discovery turned out to be one of the most significant archeological finds in history.</p>
<p>So why haven’t you heard about it?</p>
<p>Probably because Hunter chose to keep his discovery secret until after he died. He was afraid that if word got out too soon, looters would descend on the tomb like vultures and destroy everything in their haste to steal it all.</p>
<p>But Hunter’s secret didn’t remain hidden for long. In 1992, just four years after his discovery, he died from cancer at age 73. Shortly after his death, his wife decided to reveal his amazing find to the world.</p>
<p>Since then, experts have been working hard to excavate and preserve the tomb – but it’s still not open to the public due to concerns about its fragile condition. Someday soon though, tourists may finally be able to visit this ancient Egyptian treasure trove.</p>
