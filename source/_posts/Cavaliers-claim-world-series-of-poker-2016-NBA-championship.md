#  Cavaliers claim world series of poker 2016 NBA championship

In a stunning turn of events that few saw coming, the Cleveland Cavaliers have claimed the world series of poker 2016 NBA championship. The Cavs have been on an improbable run after losing their star player, LeBron James, to free agency in the summer of 2016.

Many experts believed that the Cavs would struggle to make it out of the first round of the playoffs, but they managed to reach the NBA Finals by upsetting the heavily favored Golden State Warriors in seven games. In the Finals, they faced off against the team that had eliminated them the year before, the 73-win Warriors.

The Cavs emerged victorious in a thrilling Game 7 that went into overtime. Kyrie Irving was named MVP of the Finals, leading both teams in scoring and assists.

This is Cleveland’s first championship since 1964 and this victory is sure to bring joy to a city that has suffered through a great deal of hardship in recent years.

#  Golden State Warriors crowned world series of poker 2016 NBA champs

The Golden State Warriors are the new world champions of poker! Earning their first poker championship title in dramatic fashion, the Warriors beat out the competition in a nail-biter of a world series of poker (WSOP) 2016 final.

The Warriors' road to the top was not easy though. In an emotional and close-fought battle, they had to overcome some of the best poker players in the world. The final challenge came from none other than the Cleveland Cavaliers – last year's champions.

In what was an epic game, the Warriors pulled out all the stops to emerge victorious. Steph Curry, in particular, was on fire, scoring a record 35 points and leading his team to victory.

This is a history-making moment for the Golden State Warriors – and a well-deserved one at that!

#  Oklahoma City Thunder victorious in world series of poker 2016 NBA playoffs

The Oklahoma City Thunder have come out on top in the world series of poker 2016. It was a grueling battle that went right down to the wire, but the Thunder managed to pull out the victory in the end.

Russell Westbrook was an absolute monster during the playoffs, putting up some absolutely staggering numbers. He averaged 30 points per game during the postseason, and also averaged 10 rebounds and 10 assists. This was a true triple-double machine, and he was virtually unstoppable at times.

Westbrook was ably supported by some other key players on the team. Kevin Durant was his usual excellent self, averaging 27 points per game. And Victor Oladipo had a breakout postseason, averaging 16 points per game.

The Thunder will now face the Golden State Warriors in what is sure to be an epic clash. The Warriors are coming off of a record-breaking season, and they will be looking to add an NBA championship to their list of accomplishments. But the Thunder are not going to make it easy for them. They have proved themselves as one of the elite teams in the NBA, and they will give Golden State everything they can handle.

It should be a tremendous series, with plenty of highlights along the way. Be sure to tune in and see all the action!

#  San Antonio Spurs win world series of poker 2016 NBA Western Conference Finals

The San Antonio Spurs emerged victorious in the world series of poker 2016 NBA Western Conference Finals, defeating the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games. Led by superstar forward Kawhi Leonard, who averaged 31 points and nine rebounds per game in the series, the Spurs proved to be too much for the Thunder to handle.

In a back-and-forth series that featured several momentum swings, it was San Antonio's experience and championship pedigree that ultimately proved to be the difference. The Spurs not only have more playoff experience than the Thunder, they also have four championships under their belt, compared to Oklahoma City's one.

With their victory over the Thunder, the Spurs have now qualified for their 21st consecutive playoff appearance, an NBA record. They will look to add a fifth championship banner to their rafters when they take on the Golden State Warriors in the NBA Finals.

Toronto Raptors clinch first-ever world series of poker 2016 NBA Eastern Conference Finals berth
On Sunday, the Toronto Raptors clinched their first-ever berth in the world series of poker (WSOP) Eastern Conference Finals. DeMar DeRozan led the way with 19 points, while Kyle Lowry added 16 points and eight assists.

“It’s a great feeling,” Lowry said. “We knew this was a big game for us. We worked hard all year and deserve to be in the Eastern Conference Finals.”

The victory set up a showdown with the Cleveland Cavaliers, who have had the Raptors’ number in recent years. Cleveland has beaten Toronto in each of their last two meetings in the playoffs, including a sweep in last year’s conference semifinals.

Despite that history, the Raptors are confident heading into the next round.

“I think we can beat them,” DeRozan said. “We have to play our game and not worry about what they do. If we do that, I think we can come out on top.”

The Cavaliers will certainly be a tough opponent, but if Toronto plays like they did against Milwaukee, they have a chance to pull off an upset.
