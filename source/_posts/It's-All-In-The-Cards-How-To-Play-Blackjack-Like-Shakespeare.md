#  It's All In The Cards: How To Play Blackjack Like Shakespeare

In the 1990s, a blackjack team of experts led by Michael Kaplan took the Vegas casinos for millions of dollars. One of their techniques? Playing blackjack like Shakespeare.

The strategy is deceptively simple. Rather than playing each hand according to basic strategy, the team would assign one of four roles to each player:
1) The Actor: Plays basic strategy and tries to draw attention from the dealers and pit bosses.
2) The Director: Keeps track of the cards and makes suggestions to other players.
3) The Writer: Makes notes on what's happening in the game.
4) The Producer: Calls the shots and manages the team's bankroll.

The key is for everyone to know their role and to stick to it. The Actor attracts attention with big bets and then quickly retreats to let the Director take over. The Director monitors the cards and makes suggestions to the Writer, who records what's happening. The Producer makes decisions on when and how much to bet.
3-Card Monte

   Blackjack isn't the only game where this approach can be used; it can also be applied to 3-card monte. In this scam, three cards are dealt face down on a table, with one card being a fake - a queen, say. Asked to pick out the queen, most people will guess wrong, because they're focusing on trying to find a specific card rather than looking at all three cards as a group. By using this approach, you can avoid being scammed by con artists using 3-card monte.

#  From The Bard To Blackjack: A Guide To Playing The Game

In the mood for something a little different? Want to try your luck at the casino but don't know how to play? This guide is for you! Here we will cover the basics of playing blackjack, from what cards to hold to when to hit or stand.

To begin, you'll need to place a bet. The minimum bet in most casinos is $5, but it can vary so be sure to check before you start playing. Once you've placed your bet, the dealer will deal two cards face up to each player, and two cards face down (the "hole" card) to themselves. The object of the game is to get as close to 21 as possible without going over.

If your first two cards are an Ace and a 10 (a "blackjack"), congratulations - you've just won! In most cases, the dealer will also have an Ace up, which means that if they draw another Ace they will bust (go over 21). If this happens, you automatically win regardless of what else happens on the table. If the dealer doesn't have blackjack, then players still in the game can either hit (take another card) or stand (stick with what they've got).

As a general rule, you'll want to hit if your hand is below 17 and stand if it's 17 or above. However, there are other factors to consider such as the type of deck being used (see below) and whether the dealer has any visible cards. Always remember that it's better to err on the side of caution and not go over 21 - in blackjack, there are no second chances!

There are several variations of blackjack available, so it's important to familiarize yourself with the specific rules before playing. For example, some games allow players to double down after splitting pairs while others prohibit it entirely. There are also various bonus payouts available for certain hands - such as getting three similar numbers (a "three-of-a-kind"), which pays out 3:2 on your original bet.

If you're feeling lucky, blackjack is a great way to give yourself a chance at winning big bucks! Just be sure to take your time learning the basics before sitting down at a table - nothing spoils the fun like losing your hard-earned money on something you don't understand. Best of luck!

#  Winning At Blackjack: A Procedure Shakespeare Would Approve Of

In Othello, Shakespeare pens one of the most famous lines in all of English literature: "to be, or not to be?" This line is perhaps best remembered for its contemplation on the essence of life itself. However, it also touches on an important decision-making question: when faced with two options, which is the better choice?

When it comes to playing blackjack, this is a question you will often face. Should you hit or stand? Should you double down or just take another card? In order to make the best decision each time, you need to understand the risks and rewards associated with each option.

If you are considering hitting, remember that there is a risk involved. If you don't get what you need, you could go bust. However, if your card makes your hand strong enough, then hitting can lead to a big win.

The same is true of doubling down. This option doubles your bet, but it also doubles your potential rewards if you are successful. So, if the odds are in your favour, doubling down can be a very smart move.

However, there is also a risk associated with doubling down. If you don't get the cards you need, you could lose big. So, it's important to weigh the risks and rewards carefully before making a decision.

In the end, the best decision for each hand will vary depending on the specific situation. But by understanding the risks and rewards associated with each option, you can make more informed decisions and increase your chances of winning at blackjack.

#  Mastering Blackjack: A Guide to Playing Like the Great Bard

Everyone knows that one of the quickest ways to go bankrupt is to try and beat the casino at blackjack. However, if you’re armed with the right insights, strategies and tactics, then you can give yourself at least a fighting chance of walking away a winner. Read on as we take you through everything you need to know about mastering this iconic casino game.

Blackjack is all about arithmetic and probability. The key to winning is to get as close to 21 as possible without going bust. In addition, the house edge can be reduced by making wise decisions about when to hit and stand.

One of the first things you need to master is understanding the different card values. An Ace can be worth either 1 or 11, while numbered cards are worth their face value. So, for example, a five of spades would be worth 5 points, while a two of clubs would be worth 2 points.

The basic strategy for blackjack is all about reducing the house edge as much as possible. This means making smart decisions about when to hit and stand based on the cards you are dealt. You can find plenty of resources online that will outline specific basic strategy charts for different scenarios. However, in general, you should always hit if your hand total is lower than 17, and stand if your hand total is higher than 17.

There are also certain advanced techniques that can help you boost your chances of winning at blackjack. One such tactic is card counting – this simply involves keeping track of how many high and low cards have been played, in order to make more accurate decisions about when to hit or stand. Another handy trick is splitting pairs – this allows you to make two separate hands from one set of cards, giving yourself more chances of winning outright or at least pushing each hand closer to 21.

If you want to take your blackjack game up a notch, then there are also some more sophisticated betting systems that you can use. The most popular system is called ‘martingale’ – this entails doubling your bet after every loss until you eventually win and recoup all your previous losses plus a profit. Although this system can work in theory, it’s not recommended that beginners use it as it can quickly lead to ruin if things don’t go your way.

Blackjack is an immensely complex game but with a little practice it’s definitely achievable to learn the basics and start beating the house edge. So roll up your sleeves and get ready for some serious gambling action!
