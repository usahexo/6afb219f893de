#  Woman Claims $5 Million Prize on Maryland Poker Game

A woman has become a millionaire overnight after winning a $5 million dollar poker game at a casino in Maryland.

The woman, who has not been named, was playing at the Horseshoe Casino in Baltimore when she won the life changing prize. She is said to have been playing for just two hours before hitting the jackpot.

According to officials at the casino, the woman was playing a game of Caribbean Stud Poker when she landed the win. She is now the fourth person to hit the big jackpot at the casino this year.

Speaking about the win, the general manager of Horseshoe Casino Baltimore, Rob Norton, said: "We are thrilled that one of our lucky players hit a major jackpot on Caribbean Stud Poker. This is a life-changing win and we wish our newest millionaire all the best."

The lucky winner has yet to comment on her win, but it is thought that she will be taking some time to enjoy her new-found wealth.

#  Woman Wins $16,000 Playing Poker in Maryland

Jennifer Harman, a renowned professional poker player, won nearly $16,000 from a game she played at Maryland Live! Casino in Hanover, Md., on Sept. 3.

The 47-year-old Las Vegas resident was one of six people who participated in a no-limit Texas hold 'em game that began at approximately 7 p.m. and lasted more than nine hours. According to a spokesperson for the casino, the pot reached its peak when Harman's pocket kings held up against her opponents' ace-high hand to give her the winning hand.

In addition to the money she won from the table, Harman also took home an additional $5,000 in promotional prize money from the casino.

"It feels really good," Harman said after her victory. "I'm really happy."

The longtime professional poker player has amassed more than $2 million in tournament winnings during her career and has finished in the money at numerous World Series of Poker (WSOP) events over the years. In 2006, she even became the first woman to win two gold bracelets in open events at the WSOP.

#  Man Wins Nearly $10,000 Playing Poker in Maryland 

Last week, a Maryland man won nearly $10,000 playing poker at the MGM National Harbor casino. 

This was not the first time the man had won big at the casino. In fact, over the past year he has cashed out more than $50,000 worth of winnings. 

The man is not a professional gambler, but instead makes a living through other means. He says that poker is simply something he enjoys doing for fun. 

Interestingly, the man's success at poker has come despite a recent run of bad luck at blackjack. "I'm on a bit of a cold streak at blackjack right now," he said. "But I'm making up for it at poker." 

Poker is a complex game that can be difficult to master. However, this man's impressive track record shows that with practice and discipline, anyone can become a successful player.

#  Maryland Legalizes Slot Machines to Allow Gambling on State-Run Pokergames 

ANNAPOLIS, Md. (AP) — Maryland has become the latest state to legalize slot machines in order to allow gambling on state-run poker games. The measure, which passed the state Senate by a vote of 28-14 on Thursday, now goes to Gov. Larry Hogan for his signature.

Supporters of the bill said it would generate much-needed revenue for the cash-strapped state, while opponents argued that it would prey on vulnerable people and lead to more social problems. Under the legislation, casinos in Maryland would be allowed to offer up to five poker tables each, with players able to bet up to $10 per hand.

The state’s five existing casinos would be allowed to add no more than 40 new poker tables each, and a new casino could have up to 120 tables. In addition, limited video lottery terminals that already exist at some truck stops could be used for poker games under the legislation.

Maryland is not the only state turning to poker as a way to raise revenue. Lawmakers in Pennsylvania are also considering legalizing online poker as a way to help close that state’s budget deficit.

#  Player Claims $9,600 Win on Maryland Live! Casino Poker Game

On the afternoon of December 10, 2017, a player identified as "Brian" walked away from the Maryland Live! Casino poker room in Hanover, Maryland, with a $9,600 win. Brian told reporters that he had been playing at a $1/$2 no-limit table and that the big winning hand was a full house.

According to Brian, he had put in about eight hours of play at the casino that day and was up about $2,000 going into the final hand. He said that he was originally all-in for $1,700 before the flop came out J♦9♥8♦. The turn card was the 7♣, giving him two pair, jacks and sevens. The river card was the 2♦, making his final hand three of a kind, jacks. This hand beat his opponent's two pair, queens and eights.

Casino officials declined to comment on the specific game or players involved. However, they confirmed that an individual had won $9,600 at a poker table on December 10th. This is not the first big win for Brian at Maryland Live! Casino; he previously took down a $10,000 winners' circle event there in May of 2016.
