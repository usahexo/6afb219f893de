#  Was Michael Crichton a successful writer before or after writing Jurassic Park?

Michael Crichton is well known as the author of Jurassic Park, but some may not be aware that he was a successful writer long before that. Crichton published his first novel, The Great Train Robbery, in 1968, and it was met with critical acclaim. He followed that up with a string of other successes, including The Andromeda Strain and Congo. It wasn't until 1990 that Jurassic Park was published, but it quickly became one of the best-selling books of all time and made Crichton a household name.

So, was Michael Crichton more successful as a writer before or after writing Jurassic Park? The answer is definitely both. With successes like The Great Train Robbery and Jurassic Park under his belt, it's hard to argue that he wasn't already a successful writer by the time the latter was published. However, it's hard to deny that Jurassic Park was a watershed moment for him and put him on the map in a major way.
