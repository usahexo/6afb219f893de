            <h1 id="Blazers-Rep-Will-Push-for-Legal-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Blazers-Rep-Will-Push-for-Legal-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Blazers Rep Will Push for Legal Sports Betting"></a>Blazers Rep Will Push for Legal Sports Betting</h1><p>Oregon Rep. Earl Blumenauer says that he plans to introduce legislation in Congress that would legalize sports betting across the United States.</p>
<p>The Oregon Democrat announced his intentions on Wednesday, just one day after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down a federal law that had effectively prohibited most states from authorizing sports betting.</p>
<p>“It is time to bring this antiquated law into the 21st century,” Blumenauer said in a statement. “Let’s create a framework for legalized sports betting that will create jobs, generate tax revenue, and protect consumers.”</p>
<p> Blumenauer has been a longtime advocate of legalizing marijuana and said he believes sports betting should be treated in a similar fashion. He anticipates there will be bipartisan support for his proposed legislation.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court ruling on Monday opens the door for states to pass their own laws authorizing sports betting within their borders. Delaware, Mississippi, New Jersey, Pennsylvania and West Virginia have already enacted such legislation or are in the process of doing so.</p>
<h1 id="NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Backs-Blazers-Representative-on-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NBA-Commissioner-Adam-Silver-Backs-Blazers-Representative-on-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Backs Blazers Representative on Sports Betting"></a>NBA Commissioner Adam Silver Backs Blazers Representative on Sports Betting</h1><p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) Commissioner, Adam Silver, recently voiced his support for the position of the Portland Trail Blazers representative on the legalization of sports betting. The NBA released a statement saying that they are in support of the Representative’s efforts to overturn the gambling ban in place since 1992.</p>
<p>The NBA has been a long-time advocate for the repeal of PASPA (the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act), which is the federal law that prohibits single-game betting outside of Nevada. In May 2018, the Supreme Court overturned that law, which paved the way for states to legalize sports betting.</p>
<p>The Trail Blazers organization has been one of the most vocal proponents of legalizing sports betting in Oregon. Damian Lillard, who is the team’s All-Star point guard and co-captain, testified in front of the Oregon state legislature in favor of a bill that would allow sports betting within state lines.</p>
<p>Lillard is not alone in his support for legalizing sports betting; a number of other professional athletes have also voiced their support for it. LeBron James, arguably the biggest name in basketball, has said that he believes allowing sports betting will help to “protect the integrity” of the sport. He went on to say that he doesn’t believe that regulated sports betting will negatively impact fans’ interest in watching games.</p>
<p>Despite this growing support from athletes and organizations, there remains some opposition to legalizing sports betting. One concern that has been raised is that gambling addiction could lead to ruined lives and financial ruin. However, many opponents of legalized gambling argue that this is already an issue without legalized gambling, and it would be better to bring this activity into the open so it can be more closely monitored and regulated.</p>
<p>It remains to be seen whether Oregon will legalize sports betting in 2019; however, with strong backing from both the NBA and individual athletes like Damian Lillard, it seems likely that this will eventually happen.</p>
<h1 id="NCAA-Supports-Trail-Blazers-Representative-on-Sports-Betting"><a href="#NCAA-Supports-Trail-Blazers-Representative-on-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="NCAA Supports Trail Blazers Representative on Sports Betting"></a>NCAA Supports Trail Blazers Representative on Sports Betting</h1><p>On Thursday, September 6, the NCAA Board of Governors voted to endorse a federal sports betting bill that would allow states to regulate and operate sports betting. The move provides a measure of support for Trail Blazers Representative Brian Schatz’s proposed legislation.</p>
<p>Schatz’s Sports Wagering Act of 2018, if passed, would protect the integrity of collegiate sports while also allowing states to legalize and regulate sports betting. The NCAA has previously been outspoken against legalized sports gambling but has come around to Schatz’s proposal in light of recent court decisions which have paved the way for widespread legalization.</p>
<p>In a statement, the NCAA said: “The board’s action today allows us to support a federal framework that would provide certainty and fairness for all involved.”</p>
<p>Trail Blazers owner Paul Allen is one of several high-profile NBA owners who have lobbied in favor of legalized gambling. In a statement, Allen said: “I applaud the NCAA Board of Governors for their vote in favor of state regulation of sports betting. This is an important step forward that will provide much-needed clarity for states as they work to implement legalized sports betting.”</p>
<p>Allen and other pro-gambling NBA owners were likely heartened by a recent op-ed in The New York Times by University of Michigan law professor Erik Bauersfeld. In the piece, Bauersfeld argues that legalized sports gambling could be good for college sports, writing: “The best way to preserve college sports is not to keep them pure and unsullied but to make them more like professional athletics, which everyone seems to like anyway.”</p>
<p>While the NCAA Board of Governors’ endorsement is a major win for Schatz and pro-gambling NBA owners, it remains to be seen whether his Sports Wagering Act will gain traction in Congress.</p>
<h1 id="Blazers-Rep-to-Address-Conference-on-Sports-Betting"><a href="#Blazers-Rep-to-Address-Conference-on-Sports-Betting" class="headerlink" title="Blazers Rep to Address Conference on Sports Betting"></a>Blazers Rep to Address Conference on Sports Betting</h1><p>The National Basketball Association (NBA) has tapped into its Portland Trail Blazers’ representative to address a gambling conference in Europe focused on the future of sports betting. NBA Commissioner Adam Silver is scheduled to speak, but the league has not released information on who will represent the Blazers.</p>
<p>Reports surfaced in February that the NBA was looking for a team to send to speak at the conference organized by Sportradar, a data and technology company that partnered with the NBA in 2016. The conference is set for May 14-15 in London.</p>
<p>When asked about Silver’s involvement, a spokesperson for the NBA said, “Commissioner Silver will be discussing our approach to sports betting globally and how we are collaborating with our teams and league partners to protect the integrity of our sport.”</p>
<p>Gambling on professional sports is nothing new, but it has been receiving more attention in recent years as countries around the world have legalized or explored legalizing sports betting. The U.S., however, has been slower to come around. In 1992, Congress passed the Professional and Amateur Sports Protection Act, which effectively banned sports betting except in Nevada.</p>
<p>In May 2018, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down that law, opening the door for states to legalize sports betting within their borders. Since then, several states have approved legislation or started discussions on how to move forward with regulating sports betting.</p>
<p>Oregon is not one of those states; gambling is illegal in Oregon outside of tribal casinos. But Blazers owner Paul Allen is no stranger to gambling; he owns Seattle-based Rock Gaming LLC, which operates five gaming venues in Ohio including two casinos.</p>
<p>Allen has been outspoken about his support for legalizing sports betting. In a November 2018 interview with CNBC, he said: “You have all these people who are fans of teams and they’re interested in outcomes of games and there ought to be a way for them to legally participate without having to break any laws or do anything shady. So I think it would be good if it was legalised and regulated… It should be up to each individual state whether they want it or not – I don’t think it should be a federal thing – but I do think it would be good if it was legalised and everyone could benefit from that kind of activity rather than having it underground where you don’t know what you’re getting into necessarily.”</p>
<p>The legality of sports betting is only part of the puzzle; another major issue is how to protect the integrity of sporting events when money is on the line. The NBA has long been outspoken on this issue, even before Silver became commissioner in 2014. He has said that he believes legalized sports betting can coexist with strong integrity protections put into place by governing bodies like the NBA.</p>
<h1 id="Jrue-Holiday-Leads-Pelicans-Past-Trail-Blazers-106-105-Sports-Bettors-Lose-Another"><a href="#Jrue-Holiday-Leads-Pelicans-Past-Trail-Blazers-106-105-Sports-Bettors-Lose-Another" class="headerlink" title="Jrue Holiday Leads Pelicans Past Trail Blazers 106-105; Sports Bettors Lose Another"></a>Jrue Holiday Leads Pelicans Past Trail Blazers 106-105; Sports Bettors Lose Another</h1><p>Jrue Holiday scored 33 points and E’Twaun Moore added 20 to lead the New Orleans Pelicans past the Portland Trail Blazers 106-105 on Thursday night.</p>
<p>Holiday, who had 19 points in the fourth quarter, made a driving layup with 3.2 seconds left to give New Orleans the lead for good.</p>
<p>Damian Lillard had a chance to win it for Portland, but his 18-foot jumper bounced off the rim as time expired.</p>
<p>The loss was another heartbreaker for sports bettors, who watched their investments go up in flames as they continue to lose money on a consistent basis.</p>
<p>“It’s really tough,” said one gambler who asked to remain anonymous. “I’ve been betting on sports for years and I’ve never seen anything like this. It seems like every game I bet on ends up being decided by one or two points.”</p>
<p>According to SportsInsights.com, NBA teams have covered the spread just 43.8% of the time this season, which is well below the historical average of 54%. This has resulted in millions of dollars being lost by bettors across the country.</p>
<p>“It’s been brutal,” said Mike Perry, president of SportsInsights.com. “We’ve never seen such a discrepancy between public opinion and actual results. The books are winning big time right now, and there’s not much that can be done about it.”</p>
<p>Despite the losses, however, many gamblers say they have no intention of quitting anytime soon.</p>
<p>“I’m in it for the long haul,” said one gambler. “I know I’m going to lose more games than I win, but that’s part of the gamble. I’m not going to give up just because things aren’t going my way.”</p>
