Once there, take highway 190 east until you reach the town of Thackerville, OK. From there, take highway 77 north until you reach the casino.</p>
<p>The trip should take around 4 hours and 30 minutes, depending on traffic.</p>

Families can also enjoy spending time at Dell Diamond – home of the Round Rock Express baseball team – or catching a movie at one of Buda’s two cinemas.</p>
<p>If casino gaming is more your thing, then WinStar is definitely worth considering. The casino offers poker tournaments as well as games such as blackjack, craps, roulette, and baccarat. There are also several restaurants on site as well as a spa and several shopping outlets. Entertainment options include concerts by popular artists and Broadway productions.</p>

<p>Well, let’s take a look at some factors: How far is it? The distance from Buda to WinStar Casino is about 830 miles. That’s a long way to go for just a casino! What’s the scenery like along the way? Not too exciting – mostly flat farmland and small towns. Is there anything interesting to see or do along the way?
