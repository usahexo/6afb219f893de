The casino will reopen with a limited selection of games, but officials say they are working to add more games in the coming weeks. The hotel will also be open, but with limited rooms until all renovations are completed.

Guests who have booked reservations at the casino or hotel before October 31st will have their reservations honored and can choose to either receive a refund or reschedule their stay for a later date.

The casino is expected to create around 300 jobs, including 150 new full-time jobs. In addition to the casino, a hotel and conference center are also being built on the property.

Rocky Gap Casino is expected to reopen its doors just in time for the new year after months of extensive renovations. The casino, located in the heart of western Maryland’s Allegany County, has been closed for over half a year as it undergoes a $42 million renovation project.

The renovation project is part of an effort to breathe new life into the casino and help it compete with larger casinos in neighboring states. The overhaul will include a new poker room, high limit gaming area, and a full-service restaurant. In addition, the casino will offer an updated slot floor with new games and improved player tracking.

Renovation work on the casino began last summer and is scheduled to be completed by the end of December. According to officials at Rocky Gap Casino, the reopening will create 80 new jobs.

“We are very excited to reopen our doors just in time for the New Year,” said general manager Matt DiBari. “This renovation project is much needed and will provide our guests with a much improved gaming experience.”

Rocky Gap Casino first opened its doors in 2006 and has since become a popular destination for gamblers in western Maryland. In addition to its slots and table games, the casino also features live entertainment and a variety of dining options.
