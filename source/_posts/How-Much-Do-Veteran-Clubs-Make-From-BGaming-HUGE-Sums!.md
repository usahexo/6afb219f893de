#  How Much Do Veteran Clubs Make From BGaming? HUGE Sums!

The leading clubs in world football, who traditionally have the biggest followings and generate the most income through merchandise and broadcasting deals, earn millions of dollars in revenue from betting each season.

How much? Let's take a look at the numbers.

FC Barcelona is one of the most popular clubs not just in Spain but also around the world. The club generated $578 million in revenue last season, with $111 million coming from partnership arrangements with companies such as Nike, Qatar Airways and EA Sports.

But it's not just the top tier clubs that make huge sums of money from BGaming - even those in lower leagues can generate significant amounts. In England, for example, seventh-tier club Hereford FC generated £128,000 (roughly $172,000) from betting companies last year. That's more than their entire budget for the 2017-2018 season!

So why are these clubs so eager to partner with BGaming firms? It all comes down to visibility - partnering with a BGaming company gives a club massive exposure around the world. And with viewership for football games reaching billions of people each year, it's no wonder that clubs are clamoring to get involved with BGaming firms.

So if you're a fan of your local team, or just love following soccer in general, be sure to check out their partnerships with BGaming companies - you may be surprised at how much money they're making!
