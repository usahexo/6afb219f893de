The casino and hotel have been completely renovated with a new look and some new features.</p>
<p>The casino floor has been expanded and now includes a 35-table poker room, a high limit area, and a sports book. There are also several new restaurants, including The Smokehouse BBQ, Primitive Pizza, and The Lodge Buffet.</p>
<p>The hotel has also been updated with new rooms and suites. There are now six different room types, including the new Rocky Gap Tower Suites which offer stunning views of the Allegheny Mountains.</p>
<p>The renovations have been long awaited by the local community and are sure to be a big hit during the holiday season.</p>
<h1 id="Rocky-Gap-Casino-Announces-Plans-to-Reopen-in-November"><a href="#Rocky-Gap-Casino-Announces-Plans-to-Reopen-in-November" class="headerlink" title="Rocky Gap Casino Announces Plans to Reopen in November!"></a>Rocky Gap Casino Announces Plans to Reopen in November!</h1><p>Rocky Gap Casino Resort officials announced plans to reopen the casino and hotel in November. The casino has been closed since late October when a fire destroyed several areas of the facility.</p>
<p>“We are excited to reopen and welcome our guests back,” said casino spokesperson Tara Little. “The fire did extensive damage, but we have been working hard to get everything ready for reopening. We appreciate the patience of our guests and look forward to hosting them again soon.”</p>
<p>The casino will reopen with a limited selection of games, but officials say they are working to add more games in the coming weeks. The hotel will also be open, but with limited rooms until all renovations are completed.</p>
<p>Guests who have booked reservations at the casino or hotel before October 31st will have their reservations honored and can choose to either receive a refund or reschedule their stay for a later date.</p>
<p>Rocky Gap Casino Resort is located in Flintstone, Maryland and offers gaming options including slots, table games, and poker. The casino also has a hotel, spa, golf course, and restaurants.</p>
<h1 id="Rocky-Gap-Casino-to-re-open-this-December"><a href="#Rocky-Gap-Casino-to-re-open-this-December" class="headerlink" title="Rocky Gap Casino to re-open this December!"></a>Rocky Gap Casino to re-open this December!</h1><p>Rocky Gap Casino is set to re-open this December according to officials. The casino, which closed in February of 2018, will undergo $10 million worth of renovations in order to modernize and update the facility.</p>
<p>The casino is expected to create around 300 jobs, including 150 new full-time jobs. In addition to the casino, a hotel and conference center are also being built on the property.</p>
<p>This is great news for the economy of Western Maryland and for those who are looking for jobs. I am excited to see what the finished product looks like and I am sure that it will be a popular destination for those in the area!</p>
<h1 id="Rocky-Gap-Casino-set-to-reopen-doors-by-New-Years"><a href="#Rocky-Gap-Casino-set-to-reopen-doors-by-New-Years" class="headerlink" title="Rocky Gap Casino set to reopen doors by New Years!"></a>Rocky Gap Casino set to reopen doors by New Years!</h1><p>Rocky Gap Casino is expected to reopen its doors just in time for the new year after months of extensive renovations. The casino, located in the heart of western Maryland’s Allegany County, has been closed for over half a year as it undergoes a $42 million renovation project.</p>
<p>The renovation project is part of an effort to breathe new life into the casino and help it compete with larger casinos in neighboring states. The overhaul will include a new poker room, high limit gaming area, and a full-service restaurant. In addition, the casino will offer an updated slot floor with new games and improved player tracking.</p>
<p>Renovation work on the casino began last summer and is scheduled to be completed by the end of December. According to officials at Rocky Gap Casino, the reopening will create 80 new jobs.</p>
<p>“We are very excited to reopen our doors just in time for the New Year,” said general manager Matt DiBari. “This renovation project is much needed and will provide our guests with a much improved gaming experience.”</p>
<p>Rocky Gap Casino first opened its doors in 2006 and has since become a popular destination for gamblers in western Maryland. In addition to its slots and table games, the casino also features live entertainment and a variety of dining options.</p>
<h1 id="Rocky-Gap-Casino-opening-again-before-you-can-say-jackpot"><a href="#Rocky-Gap-Casino-opening-again-before-you-can-say-jackpot" class="headerlink" title="Rocky Gap Casino opening again before you can say jackpot!"></a>Rocky Gap Casino opening again before you can say jackpot!</h1><p>After a brief closure, Rocky Gap Casino Resort has announced that it will reopen on Friday, January 12. This is great news for the many people who enjoy the casino’s amenities, including its slot machines, table games, and restaurants.</p>
<p>According to the casino’s website, it will offer a “comprehensive renovation” during its closure. This renovation is likely in response to the fact that, according to The Washington Post, the casino has been struggling financially in recent years.</p>
<p>Despite this, the casino remains a popular destination for many people in western Maryland and neighboring states. In addition to its gaming options, the casino also offers a variety of restaurants, including a steakhouse and an Italian restaurant. It also has a hotel with over 200 rooms.</p>
<p>If you are looking for a place to gamble or just have some fun food and drinks, Rocky Gap Casino Resort is definitely worth checking out. Its reopening is sure to be cause for celebration among its many fans!</p>
