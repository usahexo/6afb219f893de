#  Hard Rock Online Casino Uses PlanetWin365 Drug Test

The operator of Hard Rock Casino in Atlantic City, New Jersey has announced that it will start using the services of online gaming technology provider PlanetWin365 to drug test its employees.

The new policy, which will be implemented on November 1st, will require all full and part-time employees working in positions such as cashiers, dealers, pit bosses, and surveillance staff to provide a urine sample for testing.

According to a statement from the casino's parent company, the decision was made in light of recent allegations of drug use by industry workers.

"Given the current environment in the gaming industry, we felt it was important to take this additional step to ensure that our employees are adhering to the highest standards," said Hard Rock Casino CEO Mark Juliano.

PlanetWin365 is one of the largest providers of online gaming software in the world, with over 2 million registered users. The company offers a suite of products that include sports betting, casino games, and poker. It also provides services for regulating and monitoring gambling activity across multiple jurisdictions.

#  Hard Rock Online Casino Adopts PlanetWin365 Drug Test

Just a few weeks ago, the Hard Rock online casino made a bit of a splash when they announced that they would be using the software of the Italian gaming company, PlanetWin365. This announcement was made shortly after the US Department of Justice indicted three executives from Playtech Ltd., the world’s largest publicly traded online gambling company.

According to the DoJ, these executives engaged in money laundering and wire fraud schemes that amounted to over $350 million. It looks like the Hard Rock Casino is looking to distance themselves from any possible associations with money laundering and other illegal activities.

This is where PlanetWin365 comes in. The company is known for their stringent anti-money laundering policies and their commitment to customer safety. In addition to their regular anti-money laundering protocols, PlanetWin365 also uses cutting-edge technology to detect any suspicious behavior on the part of players.

This technology includes both facial recognition software and artificial intelligence algorithms that can detect unusual betting patterns. In other words, if you start betting heavily on blackjack one day after never having played blackjack before, PlanetWin365 will take notice.

This technology has already proven itself valuable in helping PlanetWin365 identify and shut down several illegal gambling operations. So it’s no surprise that the Hard Rock Casino has decided to partner up with them.

The move has been welcomed by many in the industry, who view it as a sign that casinos are finally taking customer safety seriously. It’s also been praised by lawmakers, who see it as a way to help crack down on illegal gambling activities.

Ultimately, this move should help make the online casino industry more safe and secure for everyone involved. Thanks, Hard Rock Casino!

#  Hard Rock Casino Goes with PlanetWin365 Drug Test

As part of their stringent anti-gambling policy, the Hard Rock casino has announced that all employees must submit to a drug test before starting work. The new policy, which comes into effect on 1st January 2019, will see all employees tested for cannabis, cocaine, opioids and other illegal drugs.

The casino says that the decision is in response to increasing concerns about the impact of gambling addiction on employees and their families. "We want to make sure that our employees are healthy and free from any dependencies that could affect their ability to work safely and effectively," said a spokesperson for the casino.

The drug test will be administered by PlanetWin365, one of the leading providers of online sports betting services. "We are very pleased to have been selected by Hard Rock Casino to provide the drug testing service," said a spokesperson for PlanetWin365. "Our thorough and accurate testing procedure will ensure that all employees are clean and ready to work."

PlanetWin365 is well known for its rigorous anti-gambling policies. In addition to drug testing, the company also conducts extensive background checks on all its employees.

#  Hard Rock Online Casino to Use PlanetWin365 Drug Test

According to a report from the <a href="https://gambling.com/">Gambling.com</a> website, the upcoming launch of the Hard Rock Online Casino will be using the player verification services of PlanetWin365. This move is being made in order to help ensure that only players who are of legal age are able to play at the site. In order to do this, all players who sign up for an account with Hard Rock Online Casino will be required to provide proof of identity and age.

One of the ways that PlanetWin365 will be helping with this is by requiring all players to submit to a drug test. This means that in order to create an account and play at Hard Rock Online Casino, you will need to provide a valid government-issued ID and also agree to have your urine tested for drugs.

The reason for this stringent security measure is likely twofold. First, it's no secret that online casinos are often used by problem gamblers as a way to fuel their addiction. The hope is that by using a service like PlanetWin365, Hard Rock Online Casino can reduce the chances of problem gamblers being able to get access to their games.

Second, it's no secret that casino games can be used as a way to launder money. By requiring all players to submit to a drug test, Hard Rock Online Casino is hoping to discourage any would-be criminals from trying to use their site as a way to clean their ill-gotten gains.

While some players may balk at the idea of having to provide a urine sample in order to play casino games, it's important to remember that this is just one of many security measures that online casinos use in order to protect their customers.
