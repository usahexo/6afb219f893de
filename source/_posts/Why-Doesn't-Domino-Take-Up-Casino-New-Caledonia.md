#  Why Doesn't Domino Take Up Casino New Caledonia?

The French Pacific territory of New Caledonia is seeking to establish a casino and gaming industry in an effort to stimulate the economy. The New Caledonian government recently granted licenses for two casinos, one of which will be managed by the world's largest casino operator, Galaxy Entertainment Group. The other casino license was granted to Hong Kong-based property development company Landing International Development Ltd.

Why doesn't Domino Gaming want in on this?

There are a few reasons. For one, the market potential may not be as great as it seems. The population of New Caledonia is just over 260,000 people, and while that is a sizable market, it's not exactly a huge opportunity in the grand scheme of things. Additionally, there is some competition in the region already – both from other casinos and from online gaming sites.

Then there are the regulatory hurdles. Establishing a casino in New Caledonia requires complying with a number of regulations and laws governing the gaming industry. This can be time-consuming and expensive, and it's not always clear what is required or how to meet all the requirements.

Finally, there is always the risk that a new casino will not be successful. This can happen for any number of reasons – too much competition, poor marketing and management, etc. If a casino fails, that can be costly for everyone involved – including the casino operators, the investors and the local government.

So why doesn't Domino Gaming jump into this opportunity? There are plenty of reasons why it may not be worth it for them at this point.

#  Why Is Domino Passing On Casino New Caledonia?

According to the latest news release, Domino is pulling the plug on its Casino New Caledonia property. The company is citing consistent financial losses as the reason for the closure, which will see around 390 employees out of work. This announcement comes as a surprise to many industry watchers, who had expected Domino to take steps to improve performance at the property rather than simply close it down.

So why has Domino decided to give up on Casino New Caledonia? There are several potential reasons for this decision.

First, it's possible that Domino is simply focusing its resources on other properties in order to improve overall performance. The company has been struggling financially in recent years, and so it makes sense that it would want to allocate its resources in the most efficient way possible.

Second, it's possible that Casino New Caledonia was simply unprofitable from the start. This could be due to a variety of factors such as high operating costs or a limited customer base. In any case, it's likely that Domino didn't see any potential for turning a profit at the property and decided it was best to pull out altogether.

Finally, it's possible that Domino is reacting to increasing competition in the New Caledonian casino market. With new properties opening up in recent years, it's becoming increasingly competitive landscape and companies like Domino may not feel confident about their ability to compete moving forward.

Whatever the reason may be, this announcement is sure to have a ripple effect on the casino industry in New Caledonia. 390 employees are now out of work, and many other companies will likely face increased competition as a result of this decision.

#  Casino New Caledonia: Why Isn't Domino Interested?

With the construction of the Casino New Caledonia well underway, some are asking why Hong Kong based gaming company Domino isn't more interested in getting involved. After all, the new casino is being built right next to the colossal and profitable Solaire Resort and Casino, which is owned by none other than Domino.

Industry insiders say that there are a few reasons for Domino's lack of interest. For starters, the Casino New Caledonia is being built in partnership with Melco International Development, which is a major competitor of Domino in the Asian gaming market. Additionally, Solaire Resort and Casino has been thriving and it's unlikely that New Caledonia will be able to siphon away much business from it. Finally, it's speculated that Domino is focusing its attention on expanding its operations in Japan instead.

Still, it's surprising that Domino hasn't shown more interest in the new casino, especially given its proximity to Solaire. It will be interesting to see how things play out once it's up and running.

#  Why Won't Domino Expand Into Casino New Caledonia?

In the past, Domino has been more than willing to explore new markets and offer their products and services in countries all over the world. So why are they hesitating to expand into Casino New Caledonia? The answer may have to do with the fact that Casino New Caledonia is a relative newcomer in the gaming industry, and there is some uncertainty about how successful it will be.

Another potential obstacle for Domino is that Casino New Caledonia is backed by Malaysia-based casino operator NagaCorp Ltd. NagaCorp is a well-established company with a proven track record in the gaming industry, so it's possible that Domino feels that Casino New Caledonia might be too competitive.

There are also concerns about the regulatory environment in New Caledonia. The government there has been known to be unpredictable, which could create problems for Domino if they decide to expand into the market.

At this point, it's unclear whether or not Domino will actually move forward with plans to enter the Casino New Caledonia market. However, given the company's past track record of success in new markets, it's likely that they will at least consider the possibility.
