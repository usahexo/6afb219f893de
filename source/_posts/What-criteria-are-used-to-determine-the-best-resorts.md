#  Who chooses the resorts?

Resorts are often chosen by those who seek an escape from their every day lives. They offer a luxurious setting where people can relax and rejuvenate. There are many resorts that cater to different types of people, so it is important to know what you are looking for before making a decision.

One big question people have is who chooses the resorts? The answer to this question is both the guests and the resort owners. The guests get to choose what they want in a resort and the owners get to choose what resorts they want to offer. This creates a perfect balance between what the guests want and what the resort can provide.

There are many factors that go into choosing a resort. Some of the most important factors are:

-The type of experience you want
-Your budget
-The location
-The amenities
-The type of crowd the resort attracts

Each of these factors are important when making a decision about where you will spend your vacation. You need to consider all of them when making a choice. For example, if you want an adventure filled vacation, then you would want to choose a resort that offers outdoor activities. If you are looking for a relaxing beach holiday, then you would want to choose a resort near the ocean.

Some people may find that it is difficult to decide on which resort is best for them. In this case, it may be helpful to ask friends or family members for recommendations. They may have stayed at a great resort recently that would be perfect for your next vacation. Online reviews can also be helpful in narrowing down your choices. Once you have some ideas about which resorts might be good for you, it is time to start planning your trip!

#  What happens if a resort is not happy with being included on the list?

If a resort is not happy with being included on the list, they may ask to be removed. However, if they are removed from the list, they may lose some benefits that come with being on the list.
