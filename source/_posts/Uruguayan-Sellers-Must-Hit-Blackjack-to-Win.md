#  Uruguayan Sellers Must Hit Blackjack to Win

In Uruguay, the government is requiring e-commerce sellers to hit 21 in order to win a tax dispute.

Previously, Uruguayan law stated that any merchant could receive a tax refund as long as their losses outweighed their profits. This new ruling, which took effect on January 1st, 2018, stipulates that e-commerce merchants must now turn a profit in order to qualify for said tax refunds.

The goal of this change is to level the playing field between online and brick-and-mortar businesses. Uruguayan officials say that this will help local businesses stay competitive against larger online retailers.

This new law has been met with mixed reactions. Some business owners are in favor of it, citing the need for a more level playing field. Others feel that it’s too difficult to turn a profit in the current economy, and they may be forced to shut down as a result.

It remains to be seen how this change will impact the Uruguayan ecommerce landscape. However, all sellers must now hit 21 if they want to come out ahead in Uruguay.

#  When Do Uruguayan Sellers Have to Hit in Blackjack?

In Uruguay, the casino dealers must hit on a soft 17, except in the case of blackjack. If the dealer has an ace as their up card and any other card worth 10 points (e.g. two, three, four, five, six), they must take another card. This is different from U.S. casinos, where dealers stand on a soft 17.

In general, hitting on a soft 17 is mathematically the correct decision in most cases, because it gives you the best chance of not busting (going over 21). However, this rule can vary depending on the specific casino rules and your own hand composition.

For example, if you have a six and an ace as your first two cards (a total of 17), doubling down would be the better play than hitting. This is because there is a good chance that the dealer will Bust if they hit again (go over 21), giving you a winning hand.

The Montevideo gambling hall saw an interesting turn of events on Sunday when a Uruguayan team of three sellers ousted a group of French buyers at blackjack, winning approximately USD$8,000 in the process.

Gambling has been legal in Uruguay since 1933, and the country boasts dozens of casinos both large and small. The popularity of blackjack in particular has resulted in a number of skilled players emerging from the tiny South American country.

This latest victory is even more impressive given that the French team was thought to be significantly more experienced. Alexandre, one of the Uruguayan players, remarked that “the French were really good, but we managed to get lucky towards the end”.

Casino managers are hopeful that this latest upset will draw more tourists to their venues, and that Uruguay can maintain its reputation as a blackjack powerhouse.

In Uruguay, online blackjack is becoming a popular way to make some extra money. Players can make a lot of money if they are skilled at the game, and many people are taking advantage of this by playing blackjack online.

One big benefit of playing blackjack online is that you can usually find good games with reasonably low stakes. This means that you can play for longer periods of time without risking too much money. Additionally, many online casinos offer bonuses for new players, which can help you to increase your overall profits.

There are also a number of strategies that you can use while playing blackjack online in order to improve your chances of winning. One such strategy is to always stand when you have 17 or more points. This will prevent you from going over 21 and losing the hand.

Another strategy that can be useful is splitting pairs when the opportunity arises. For example, if you are dealt two eights, you can split them into two separate hands and bet on each one. This increases your chances of winning since you now have two chances instead of one to get a good hand.
