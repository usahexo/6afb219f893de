#  Casino Days is the new way to bet on sports!

Casino Days is the new way to bet on sports. Instead of betting on games through a traditional sportsbook, Casino Days allows users to bet on matchups and player performances using casino-style games. This innovative approach makes it easy for users to make bets on their favorite teams, adding an extra level of excitement to game watching.

One of the best things about Casino Days is that it offers great odds on games. In fact, the odds are often better than what you would find at a traditional sportsbook. This makes it a great option for anyone who wants to increase their chances of winning money on sporting events.

Another great thing about Casino Days is that it offers a wide variety of betting options. You can bet on everything from the winner of a game to the number of points scored by a particular player. This gives you plenty of flexibility when making your bets, and ensures that you can find something to bet on no matter which games you are following.

Finally, Casino Days is convenient and easy to use. The website is attractively designed and easy to navigate, making it quick and easy to place your bets. There is also a handy FAQ section that can answer any questions you may have about the site’s functionality.

If you are looking for a new way to bet on sports, then Casino Days is definitely worth checking out!

#  Sports betting is now legal in Virginia!

On July 1, 2019, sports betting became legal in Virginia. This new legislation allows for both in-person and online sports betting.

The specifics of the new law are as follows:

-Residents must be at least 21 years old to place a bet.

-Only the state lottery may offer online sports betting.

-There is a 10% tax on all bets, except for bets on horse racing, which are taxed at 6%.

-The state lottery will take a 27% cut of all online sports betting revenue.

Virginians can now legally bet on sports teams from around the world. They can also place bets on U.S. collegiate and professional sporting events. Some examples of bets that Virginians can now place include:

-Which team will win a particular game or game series?
Bets like this are called "matchups."  For example, you might wager $10 that the Washington Nationals will beat the New York Mets.  If they do, you would receive $20 back ($10 wagered plus $10 in winnings).  If the Nationals lose, you would lose your $10 wagered. 
-How many points will be scored in a particular game?  This is called a "point spread" bet.  For example, you might wager $10 that the point spread for the Ohio State vs Michigan football game is greater than 47.5 points . If it is, then you would win $10 (plus your original $10 wagered). If it's not, then you would lose your original $10 wagered. 

Bets like these two are examples of "over/unders." You are betting on whether or not the total number of points scored in a game will be over or under a certain number that has been set by bookmakers.  For example, if you wanted to bet that the total number of points scored in the Ohio State vs Michigan football game would be over 47.5 points , you would bet on the "over." If you wanted to bet that the total number of points scored in the Ohio State vs Michigan football game would be under 47.5 points , you would bet on the "under."
