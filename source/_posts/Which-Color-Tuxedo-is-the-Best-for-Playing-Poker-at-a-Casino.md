2. Gray – A gray tuxedo can provide a bit more contrast than black, which can be helpful when playing against lighter-colored opponents.

3. Blue – A blue tuxedo can make you look cool and confident – perfect for bluffing your way to victory.

4. Burgundy – A burgundy tuxedo can exude sophistication and power, making you feel like a king of the casino tables.
